# lego star wars the skywalker saga credits converter
This program converts a text into the right format to be shown in the credits screen.
I wanted to have the Bee Movie Script as credits so i wrote this script to do it for me, 
maybe someone else also finds it useful.

## How to use it
### for the exe file
Just drag and drop the input .txt file on the exe file, and you will get an "CREDITS_PC.txt" output file,
which you can drag into the unpacked "LEGO_Star_Wars_The_Skywalker_Saga\STUFF\TEXT" folder.

### for the .py file
If the exe doesn't work, or you don't trust it you can run the "converter_no_exe.py" file directly.

1. Have the input text in a txt file called "input.txt" in the same directory as the .py file


2. Run the script directly or in the IDE of your choice


3. Drag the newly created "CREDITS_PC.txt" into the "LEGO_Star_Wars_The_Skywalker_Saga\STUFF\TEXT" folder.
